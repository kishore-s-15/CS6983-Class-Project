# CS 6983 - Bias / Ethics Implications in AI | Enhancing Healthcare Decision-Making through Comprehensive Multimodal Data Fusion

This study investigates the potential benefits
of integrating chest X-ray images into predic-
tive models trained solely on tabular electronic
health record (EHR) data to improve predic-
tive accuracy for clinical decision-making tasks.
Leveraging the Medical Information Mart for
Intensive Care - EYE (MIMIC-EYE) dataset,
we analyze the performance of multimodal data
fusion models in binary classification tasks re-
lated to healthcare outcomes. Additionally, we
explore the variations in model performance
across diverse demographic groups, including
age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Our findings
shed light on the efficacy of integrating mul-
timodal data and highlight the importance of
considering demographic factors in healthcare
predictive modeling.
